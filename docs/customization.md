# Customization

BST Graph allows for you to locally change its colors in  code. Now, don't let that intimidate you. Thanks to Tailwind CSS, the color values can easily be changed in tailwind.config.js at the root of the directory. For each color, the DEFAULT value is what the color will be in light mode, while the dark value is what the color will be in dark mode.
