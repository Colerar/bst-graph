The autofill button uses PokeAPI to automatically fill in the stats based on the Pokemon name. However, there are a few Pokemon that do not give a response by default, usually because of an alternate form. For convenience, BST Graph modifies the name sent to PokeAPI to give a response for the base form. The changes and bindings are as follows.
